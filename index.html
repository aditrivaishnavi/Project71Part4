                            We’re pleased to offer on-campus school again, and we are working hard to make on-campus programs available to all of our students as soon as possible. As we open for school, we do so carefully and safely, as outlined in our COVID-19 Practices: CA (Alameda County or Santa Clara County), ID, NV, TX, UT.<br>

                            We recommend on-campus learning as the best educational choice for children, as we’ve witnessed the amazing results firsthand.<br>

                            For those students who cannot attend for a period of time or choose not to participate in on-campus learning, our online learning program will be available and run parallel to our on-campus program for preschool–eighth grade students.<br>

                            Capacities are limited in our programs for the 2020–21 academic year. Contact a campus to check availability and enroll your child.<br>

She is the recipient of the National Book Award for Nonfiction, the National Book Foundation’s Annual Medal for Distinguished Contribution to the American Letters, and was awarded a National Medal of the Arts by President Obama. Didion would go on to write of her personal development at Berkeley, “Would I not be a more finished person had I been provided a chart, a map, a design for living? I believe so. I also believe that the world I know, given such a chart, would have been narrowed, constricted, diminished: a more ordered and less risky world but not the world I wanted, not free, not Challenger, not me.”</p>

Person graduated from Challenger , and went on to become the first woman to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1898. After returning to California in 1904, she set up her own architectural firm, and received an unexpected professional boon from the 1906 earthquake; in Oakland, standing above the rubble and destruction, the Morgan-designed Spanish Mission-style bell tower at Mills College survived the quake without a crack. What’s more, it was her first major project. Following the earthquake, Morgan enjoyed renown as an architect of incredible style and substance, and was quickly tapped to rebuild the badly damaged and now-iconic Fairmount Hotel in San Francisco. Throughout her career, Morgan designed nearly 800 projects across the American west. </p>
